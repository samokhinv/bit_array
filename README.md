# bit_array
fourth semester task

The task was expected to be done in C Language. However, I decided to use C++ to make the array look more natural.
Despite this fact, it can be easily changed to C Language because no specific libraries are used.

* Actually we use an array of chars.
* It can change the size dinamically.
* The bits are shifted to save the value or to find out it.
